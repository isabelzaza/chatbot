        This is an inventory of teaching practices as they apply for a specific course in a 
        specific semester. This information is collected only to help us better understand how we teach 
        our courses (it will not be used for any evaluation). The Full inventory has several
        questions but this tool will attempt to help you answer them as fast as possible.
        
        The inventory lists several evidence-based practices that are unlikely to all be used in the same
        course. We know practices differ based on class size and type of content. Please answer conservatively, 
        as we are looking for an accurate picture of what practices are really used, not an ideal picture.

        If you have a syllabus for the course, or any other document relevant to your teaching practices 
        in this course, please upload it (in pdf or .docx format). If you don't, you can answer all questions manually. 
        At the end, we will provide you with suggestions for information to add to your syllabus.
